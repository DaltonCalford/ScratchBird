Lifecycle navigation:
- Previous: [CREATE](create.md)
- Next: [SHOW](show.md)

## Coverage
- Status: Supported
- Command lifecycle note: SHOW/DESCRIBE missing keeps lifecycle partial.
- Runtime note: Extension lifecycle is command-partial in 0.1.0.

## Parser Surface
```sql
ALTER EXTENSION <extension_name> <alter_actions>;
```

## Example
```sql
ALTER EXTENSION <extension_name> <alter_actions>;
```

## Notes
- This phase is documented from parser/emitter/executor evidence for 0.1.0.
- Full matrix and opcode-level notes are in [Consolidated Audit Reference](../../../NATIVE_PARSER_LANGUAGE_REFERENCE_BETA_0_1_0.md).
