Lifecycle navigation:

- Next: [Family README](../README.md)

## Coverage
- Status: Supported
- Command lifecycle note: External connection object has create/alter/drop surfaces but no explicit show/describe command.
- Runtime note: Current runtime normalization is through admin/config key contracts rather than dedicated catalog object opcode family.

## Parser Surface
```sql
DROP DATABASE CONNECTION <name>;
```

## Example
```sql
DROP DATABASE CONNECTION <name>;
```

## Notes
- This phase is documented from parser/emitter/executor evidence for 0.1.0.
- Full matrix and opcode-level notes are in [Consolidated Audit Reference](../../../NATIVE_PARSER_LANGUAGE_REFERENCE_BETA_0_1_0.md).
