Lifecycle navigation:
- Previous: [ALTER](alter.md)
- Next: [DESCRIBE](describe.md)

## Coverage
- Status: Supported
- Command lifecycle note: Missing ALTER keeps lifecycle partial.
- Runtime note: Role lifecycle is partially closed in 0.1.0.

## Parser Surface
```sql
SHOW ROLE <role_name>; SHOW ROLES;
```

## Example
```sql
SHOW ROLE <role_name>; SHOW ROLES;
```

## Notes
- This phase is documented from parser/emitter/executor evidence for 0.1.0.
- Full matrix and opcode-level notes are in [Consolidated Audit Reference](../../../NATIVE_PARSER_LANGUAGE_REFERENCE_BETA_0_1_0.md).
