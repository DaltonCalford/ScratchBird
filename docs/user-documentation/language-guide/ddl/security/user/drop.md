## Coverage
- Status: Supported
- Command lifecycle note: SHOW/DESCRIBE missing keeps lifecycle partial.
- Runtime note: Core user DDL is present; visibility is currently indirect.

## Parser Surface
```sql
DROP USER <user_name>;
```

## Example
```sql
DROP USER <user_name>;
```

## Notes
- This phase is documented from parser/emitter/executor evidence for 0.1.0.
- Full matrix and opcode-level notes are in [Consolidated Audit Reference](../../../NATIVE_PARSER_LANGUAGE_REFERENCE_BETA_0_1_0.md).
