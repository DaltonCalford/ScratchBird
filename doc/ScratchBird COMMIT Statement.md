## **In-Depth Analysis of the COMMIT Statement**

The COMMIT statement successfully terminates the current transaction and makes all of its changes permanent and visible to other transactions. Once a transaction is committed, its changes cannot be undone with a ROLLBACK.

**Syntax:**

COMMIT \[WORK\] \[RETAIN \[SNAPSHOT\]\]

### **Clause Breakdown**

* **COMMIT**: The keyword that executes the command.  
* **WORK**: (Optional) This keyword is purely for syntactic purposes and has no effect on the statement's execution. It is included for compliance with the SQL standard. COMMIT and COMMIT WORK are identical.  
* **RETAIN \[SNAPSHOT\]**: (Optional) This is a powerful ScratchBird extension that modifies the behavior of COMMIT.  
  * When RETAIN is used, the COMMIT statement makes all changes permanent, but it **does not end the transaction**. Instead, it immediately starts a new transaction with the exact same characteristics (isolation level, access mode, etc.) as the one that was just committed.  
  * All cursors opened in the previous transaction are kept open, and savepoints are preserved.  
  * This is very useful for batch processing where you want to commit work periodically without the overhead of starting a new transaction and re-establishing its context each time.  
  * The SNAPSHOT keyword is optional and has no effect; it is kept for backward compatibility.

### **Behavior and Effects**

* **Durability**: All INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations performed during the transaction are written to the database and become durable.  
* **Visibility**: Changes made by the committed transaction become visible to other transactions that start after the commit (or to READ COMMITTED transactions already in progress).  
* **Lock Release**: All locks acquired by the transaction (row locks, table locks, etc.) are released, allowing other waiting transactions to proceed.  
* **Resource Cleanup**: Database resources associated with the transaction are released. If RETAIN is not used, the transaction context is destroyed.
