## **In-Depth Analysis of the SET ROLE Statement**

The SET ROLE statement is used to establish the current SQL role for the session. A role is a collection of privileges that can be granted to users. By setting a role, the user gains all the privileges granted to that role for the duration of the current transaction or, if set outside a transaction, for the duration of the connection.

**Syntax:**

SET ROLE {role\_name | NONE | TRUSTED}

### **Clause Breakdown**

* **SET ROLE role\_name**:  
  * This is the standard form. It sets the current role to the specified role\_name.  
  * The current user must have been granted membership in the role\_name to be able to set it.  
  * Once set, the session's privilege checks will include all permissions granted to role\_name.  
* **SET ROLE NONE**:  
  * This command de-activates any current role. The session reverts to having only the privileges that were granted directly to the user account.  
* **SET ROLE TRUSTED**:  
  * This is a special, privileged form used in authentication scenarios. It allows a user who has been authenticated through a "trusted" mechanism (like Windows Authentication with SSPI) to bypass standard role membership checks and assume a role.  
  * This is typically used in conjunction with trusted authentication to map an operating system user or group to a database role. The user must have the system privilege USE\_TRUSTED\_ROLE to execute this statement.

### **Behavior and Scope**

* **Transactional Scope**: If SET ROLE is executed inside an active transaction, the role is active only for that transaction. When the transaction ends (COMMIT or ROLLBACK), the role context reverts to what it was before the transaction started.  
* **Connection Scope**: If SET ROLE is executed outside of any active transaction, the role becomes the default for the entire connection. It will remain active for all subsequent transactions until another SET ROLE statement is issued.  
* Upon connection, a user's session automatically has all roles that were granted to them with the DEFAULT option. SET ROLE can then be used to switch to other non-default roles they have been granted.
