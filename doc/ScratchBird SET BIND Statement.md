## **In-Depth Analysis of the SET BIND Statement**

The SET BIND statement is a specialized command primarily used for ensuring backward compatibility with legacy applications, particularly those that rely on specific data type representations that have changed in newer versions of ScratchBird. It controls how certain data types are "bound" or represented when they are sent from the server to the client.

**Syntax:**

SET BIND OF \<source\_type\> TO \<target\_type\>

### **Clause Breakdown**

* **SET BIND OF \<source\_type\>**:  
  * Specifies the source data type on the server whose client-side representation you want to change.  
  * \<source\_type\> can be a standard SQL data type like TIMESTAMP, TIME, DATE, or VARCHAR.  
  * It can also be TIME ZONE to control the binding of all WITH TIME ZONE types.  
* **TO \<target\_type\>**:  
  * Specifies the target representation that the client should receive.  
  * **LEGACY**: Binds the source type to its representation in older ScratchBird dialects. For example, SET BIND OF DATE TO LEGACY would cause DATE columns to be sent to the client as TIMESTAMPs, which was the behavior in Dialect 1\.  
  * **NATIVE**: Resets the binding to the modern, native representation for the current dialect.  
  * **\<data\_type\>**: You can also bind to another specific data type.  
  * **EXTENDED**: A special target for TIME WITH TIME ZONE and TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE that binds them to a representation including fractional seconds with higher precision.

### **Common Use Case: DATE Data Type**

The most common use for SET BIND relates to the DATE data type.

* In **SQL Dialect 1**, there was no separate DATE type; it was an alias for TIMESTAMP.  
* In **SQL Dialect 3**, DATE became a distinct type storing only the date part.

An older application compiled against a Dialect 1 database might expect a TIMESTAMP when it requests a DATE column. If it connects to a Dialect 3 database, it will receive a DATE and may fail.

The command SET BIND OF DATE TO LEGACY; solves this by telling the server: "Even though this column is a DATE on the server, please send it to this specific client as if it were a TIMESTAMP." This allows the legacy application to function without being rewritten.

### **Scope**

The SET BIND command is a session-level setting. It affects only the current connection and remains active until the session ends or another SET BIND command for the same source type is issued.
