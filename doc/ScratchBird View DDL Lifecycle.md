## **In-Depth Analysis of View DDL**

A view is a virtual table based on the result-set of a SELECT statement. It acts as a stored query that can be referenced like a regular table. Views are used to simplify complex queries, encapsulate business logic, and provide a layer of security by restricting access to underlying table columns.

### **CREATE VIEW**

This statement defines a new view.

**Syntax:**

CREATE \[OR ALTER\] VIEW \[IF NOT EXISTS\] view\_name  
    \[(column\_alias\_list)\]  
AS  
    select\_expression  
\[WITH CHECK OPTION\]

#### **Clause Breakdown:**

* **view\_name**: The name of the new view.  
* **(column\_alias\_list)**: (Optional) A comma-separated list of names to be used for the columns in the view. If omitted, the columns inherit the names from the select\_expression. This list is mandatory if any column in the select\_expression is a computed value without an alias.  
* **AS select\_expression**: The mandatory SELECT statement that defines the view. This can be any valid SELECT query, including joins, aggregations, etc.  
* **WITH CHECK OPTION**: (Optional) This clause enforces that any INSERT or UPDATE operations performed through the view must result in rows that are visible through the view (i.e., they must satisfy the WHERE clause of the view's select\_expression). This prevents a user from inserting a row through the view and then being unable to see it.

### **ALTER VIEW**

Modifies the definition of an existing view. The syntax is identical to CREATE VIEW and requires a full redefinition of the view's SELECT statement and options.

**Syntax:**

ALTER VIEW view\_name  
    \[(new\_column\_alias\_list)\]  
AS  
    new\_select\_expression  
\[WITH CHECK OPTION\]

Any changes to the underlying tables may require the view to be altered or recreated to remain valid.

### **DROP VIEW**

Permanently deletes a view from the database. This does not affect the data in the underlying tables.

**Syntax:**

DROP VIEW \[IF EXISTS\] view\_name;

* **IF EXISTS**: Prevents an error if the view does not exist.

### **RECREATE VIEW / CREATE OR ALTER VIEW**

These commands provide convenient ways to manage views in development and deployment environments.

* **RECREATE VIEW**: Atomically drops the view if it exists and then creates it. This is useful for ensuring a view is in a clean, known state.  
* **CREATE OR ALTER VIEW**: Modifies the view if it exists, or creates it if it does not. This is useful as it preserves existing permissions granted on the view, whereas RECREATE would cause them to be lost.

**Syntax:**

RECREATE VIEW view\_name ...  
CREATE OR ALTER VIEW view\_name ...

The rest of the syntax is identical to CREATE VIEW.
