## **In-Depth Analysis of Specific SET Commands**

This document covers several specialized SET commands used to configure session-level behavior for debugging, DECFLOAT handling, and query optimization.

### **1\. SET DEBUG OPTION**

This command is used to control internal debugging features within the ScratchBird engine. It is not intended for general application use and is typically only used by developers of the ScratchBird engine itself or for advanced troubleshooting under guidance.

**Syntax:**

SET DEBUG OPTION option\_name \= constant\_value

* **option\_name**: The name of an internal debug flag or option.  
* **constant\_value**: The value to assign to the option.

The available options and their effects are not publicly documented as they can change between versions and are highly internal to the engine's operation.

### **2\. SET DECFLOAT ROUND and SET DECFLOAT TRAPS**

These commands configure the session-level environment for handling the DECFLOAT data type, which is a decimal floating-point number type that adheres to the IEEE 754 standard.

#### **SET DECFLOAT ROUND**

This statement sets the rounding mode for DECFLOAT calculations within the current session.

**Syntax:**

SET DECFLOAT ROUND rounding\_mode

* **rounding\_mode**: A string or symbol representing one of the standard DECFLOAT rounding modes (e.g., ROUND\_HALF\_UP, ROUND\_CEILING, ROUND\_FLOOR). The available modes are defined by the underlying decNumber library used by ScratchBird.

#### **SET DECFLOAT TRAPS**

This statement controls which exceptional conditions during DECFLOAT operations will raise a trap (a SQL error).

**Syntax:**

SET DECFLOAT TRAPS TO \[trap\_name \[, trap\_name ...\]\]

* **trap\_name**: The name of a specific condition to trap. Examples include Division\_by\_zero, Overflow, Underflow, and Invalid\_operation.  
* If no traps are listed (SET DECFLOAT TRAPS TO), all traps are disabled for the session.

### **3\. SET OPTIMIZE**

This statement provides a session-level hint to the query optimizer, influencing the strategy it uses for all subsequent queries in the session. This is a less common alternative to providing the OPTIMIZE FOR hint on a per-query basis.

**Syntax:**

SET OPTIMIZE FOR {FIRST ROWS | ALL ROWS | TO DEFAULT}

* **FOR FIRST ROWS**: Tells the optimizer to prefer plans that return the first few rows of a result set as quickly as possible. This is beneficial for interactive applications with paginated results.  
* **FOR ALL ROWS**: Tells the optimizer to prefer plans that minimize the total time required to retrieve the entire result set. This is better for batch processing and reporting.  
* **TO DEFAULT**: Resets the session's optimization strategy to the server's default setting.
