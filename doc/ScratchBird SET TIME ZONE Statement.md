## **In-Depth Analysis of the SET TIME ZONE Statement**

The SET TIME ZONE statement is used to configure the time zone for the current session. This setting affects how values of the TIME WITH TIME ZONE and TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE data types are interpreted and displayed. It also influences the values returned by the CURRENT\_TIME and CURRENT\_TIMESTAMP context variables.

**Syntax:**

SET TIME ZONE { 'timezone\_string' | LOCAL }

### **Clause Breakdown**

* **SET TIME ZONE 'timezone\_string'**:  
  * This form sets the session time zone to a specific, named time zone or to a numeric offset.  
  * **Named Time Zone**: The string can be a time zone name from the IANA Time Zone Database that is supported by the server's ICU library (e.g., 'America/New\_York', 'Europe/London', 'UTC'). This is the recommended approach as it automatically handles Daylight Saving Time changes.  
  * **Numeric Offset**: The string can be a numeric offset from UTC in the format '+HH:MM' or '-HH:MM' (e.g., '-05:00'). This sets a fixed offset and does not account for Daylight Saving Time.  
* **SET TIME ZONE LOCAL**:  
  * This special keyword resets the session time zone to the default time zone of the ScratchBird server process. The server's time zone is determined by the operating system where the ScratchBird server is running.

### **Behavior and Effects**

* **Data Type Interpretation**: When you insert a TIME or TIMESTAMP value without an explicit time zone into a WITH TIME ZONE column, it is assumed to be in the current session's time zone.  
* **Data Display**: When you select data from a WITH TIME ZONE column, the value is converted from its stored UTC representation to the current session's time zone for display.  
* **CURRENT\_TIME / CURRENT\_TIMESTAMP**: The values returned by these functions will reflect the current time in the session's active time zone.  
* **Scope**: The SET TIME ZONE setting is active for the entire duration of the current connection, affecting all subsequent transactions until another SET TIME ZONE statement is issued.
