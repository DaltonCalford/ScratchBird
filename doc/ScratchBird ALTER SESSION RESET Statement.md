## **In-Depth Analysis of the ALTER SESSION RESET Statement**

The ALTER SESSION RESET statement provides a way to reset the current session (connection) to a clean state, as if the user had just connected. This is particularly useful in connection pooling environments where a single physical connection may be reused by different application users over time.

**Syntax:**

ALTER SESSION RESET

### **Behavior and Effects**

Executing ALTER SESSION RESET performs the following actions on the current connection:

1. **Commits Active Transaction**: If there is an active transaction, it is committed.  
2. **Closes Cursors**: All open cursors are closed.  
3. **Resets SET Commands**: The effects of session-level SET commands are reverted to their defaults:  
   * SET ROLE is reset. The session reverts to the user's default roles.  
   * SET TIME ZONE is reset to the server's local time zone.  
   * Other session settings are cleared.  
4. **Clears Context Variables**: All session-level context variables (set via RDB$SET\_CONTEXT) are cleared.  
5. **Resets Prepared Statements**: All prepared dynamic SQL statements are unprepared.

Essentially, it cleans up any state left behind by the previous user of the connection, ensuring the next user starts with a fresh, default environment without having to disconnect and reconnect, which is a more expensive operation.

### **RESETTING Context Variable**

A special RESETTING context variable becomes TRUE while the ALTER SESSION RESET is in progress. This can be checked in a database-level ON CONNECT trigger to perform specific setup logic for new sessions, including those that have just been reset.

**Example (in an ON CONNECT trigger):**

IF (RESETTING) THEN  
BEGIN  
  \-- Perform specific setup for a newly reset session  
END
