## **In-Depth Analysis of the ROLLBACK Statement**

The ROLLBACK statement terminates the current transaction and undoes all of the changes made during that transaction. It effectively restores the database to the state it was in at the beginning of the transaction.

**Syntax:**

ROLLBACK \[WORK\] \[RETAIN \[SNAPSHOT\]\]

### **Clause Breakdown**

* **ROLLBACK**: The keyword that executes the command.  
* **WORK**: (Optional) This keyword is purely for syntactic purposes and has no effect on the statement's execution. It is included for compliance with the SQL standard. ROLLBACK and ROLLBACK WORK are identical.  
* **RETAIN \[SNAPSHOT\]**: (Optional) This ScratchBird extension modifies the behavior of ROLLBACK.  
  * When RETAIN is used, the ROLLBACK statement undoes all changes made in the transaction, but it **does not end the transaction**. Instead, it immediately starts a new transaction with the exact same characteristics (isolation level, access mode, etc.) as the one that was just rolled back.  
  * This is less common than COMMIT RETAIN but can be useful in error handling routines where you want to undo a failed batch of work but continue processing within the same transactional context without the overhead of starting a completely new transaction.  
  * The SNAPSHOT keyword is optional and has no effect; it is kept for backward compatibility.

### **Behavior and Effects**

* **Undo Changes**: All INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations performed since the transaction started are reversed.  
* **No Visibility**: Since all changes are undone, no part of the transaction's work ever becomes visible to other transactions.  
* **Lock Release**: All locks acquired by the transaction are released, allowing other waiting transactions to proceed.  
* **Resource Cleanup**: Database resources associated with the transaction are released. If RETAIN is not used, the transaction context is destroyed.  
* **Error Handling**: ROLLBACK is a fundamental part of error handling. In PSQL, WHEN ... DO blocks often end with a ROLLBACK to ensure data integrity when an error occurs.
