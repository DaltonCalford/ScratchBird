## Relationship to FirebirdSQL

ScratchBird would not be possible without the decades of incredible work done by the FirebirdSQL team. This project is a direct fork of their work and gratefully retains the original Mozilla Public License (MPL) and InterBase Public License (IDPL).

**Key Acknowledgments**:
- Based on Firebird 6.0.0.929 (f90eae0) - ScratchBird v0.5.0
- Preserves all original licensing and attribution
- Maintains compatibility with Firebird's proven architecture
- Extends rather than replaces core functionality

**"Itch to Scratch" Philosophy**: The name reflects our desire to explore database internals and implement modern features while maintaining clear differentiation from the official Firebird project.

## Development & Methodology

This project leverages modern AI assistants, including Anthropic's Claude, to accelerate development. Their role is primarily focused on performing systematic work, such as:

- **Code Generation**: Creating comprehensive datatype implementations following established patterns
- **Compilation Issues**: Resolving build errors and template specialization challenges
- **Research & Documentation**: Analyzing PostgreSQL specifications for compatibility features
- **Testing & Validation**: Identifying edge cases and integration issues

The core architectural decisions, feature design, and project direction for ScratchBird are human-led. AI is used as a sophisticated tool to handle systematic implementation tasks, allowing development to focus on high-level database engineering challenges.

**For full transparency**: AI tools are an integral part of this project's development workflow. We respect all viewpoints on this topic, but this is a core aspect of our methodology.
